1)

Given an array Arr of size N, print all its elements.

        Example 1:

        Input:
        N = 5
        Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        Output: 1 2 3 4 5
        Example 2:

        Input:
        N = 4
        Arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 5}
        Output: 2 3 5 5
        Your Task:
        Complete the function printArray() which takes an array arr, single integer n, as input parameters and prints the value of the array space separated.

        Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
        Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


        Constraints:
        1 <= N <= 105
        1 <= Arr[i] <= 105

2)

    Given an integer array Arr[] of size N. The task is to find sum of it.

        Example 1:

        Input:
        N = 4
        Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
        Output: 10
        Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
        Example 2:

        Input:
        N = 3
        Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
        Output: 7
        Explanation: 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.
        Your Task:
        Complete the function sum() which takes array arr and single integer n, as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. You don't to print answer or take inputs.

        Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
        Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

        Constraints:
        1 <= N <= 105
        1 <= Arr[i] <= 104
